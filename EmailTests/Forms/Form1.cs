 * Programmer: Andrew Stobart (Microsoft)
 * Initial release date: March 2014
 * 
 * Description:  This application is used to send email messages for mail flow testing. 
 *               I work as a support engineer with Microsoft and support Exchange Online. 
 *               I often have the need to send email messages to particular endpoints. I 
 *               was tired of using Telnet for this and developed this application to assist 
 *               in my work.
 *               
 *

 *                            - Program now has ability to do an MX lookup
 *                            - Tabbing through text boxes now moves in order from top to bottom                           
 *                             
 *   2.1.2 (January 8, 2015): - Check box to enable a log that will always keep track of sent messages. The check box will 
 *                              just show and hide it, but it will always be active.
 *                            - Added a button to clear the log
 *                            - App will test connection to recipient server before attempting to send mail. This check takes 3 seconds.
 *                            
 *   2.2.2 (January 16, 2015) - multiple custom headers can now be added to a sent message
 *                            - MX lookups should now be more robust. If the first query does not return an MX record, the app will
 *                              query a second time before giving up.
 *                            - The above additions need to be tested. Use Wireshark to very MX Record lookups are happening the correct
 *                              number of times
 *                            - Individual rows can now be deleted from the log
 *                            
 *   2.3.1 (Feb 23, 2015)     - App adds it's own message-id to outbound messages and stamps this value in the log so it can be copied out.
 *                            - Can right click any cell in the log to copy its contents
 *                            - Window width reduced when log is visible
 *                            - Can export the log to a CSV file
 *                            - Clear Log button will now prompt for confirmation
 *                            
 *   2.3.4 (June 22, 2015)    - TCP connection to see if recipient server exists did not close after it was established. This connection
 *                              now properly closes.
 *                            - Previously, when app would open a test connection to see if the recipients was reachable, it would always use
 *                              port 25, regardless of what was entered in the app. This test now uses the entered port in the app.
 *                            - Button style on About form changed to be white and flat to match the UI in the main form  
 *                            - Changed the log text box background changed to be white to match the UI in the main form 
 *                            - Publising settings - Publisher name changed from Andrew to Mail Flow Tester. This will update
 *                              the name of the folder in the Start Menu. I also changed the app name in publishing settings to
 *                              "Mail Flow Tester v2." Without doing this, a reboot was required fœr thee snort cut to work.
 *                              put this in the about form notes but high level
 *                              
 *   2.3.5 (July 23, 2015)    - Previously, you would see RST (reset) in the WireShark capture after the server socket test, and after the app
 *                              was closed. This was becuase the socket test and message send didn't gracefully teardown the connection. When the
 *                              app was closed, it would send a RST (reset) to pull down the connection. App now properly closes the connection 
 *                              and you'll see the proer [FIN, ACK} sequence in a WireShark capture.
 *                              The following lines were added:
 *                                - socket.Disconnect(true); //close this socket in the case where a connection was made
 *                                - message.Dispose();
 *                                - client.Dispose();
 *                                
 *   2.4.1 (Sep 28, 2015)     - When the log is visible, form width can now be changed. The width the log opens at is the mimimum width that can be set, and the height cannot be changed
 *                            - link to the applications instructions have been added to the About form 
 *                            - UI updates for consistency across the application (ex. Change log text box is taller, changed wording on the P2 address check box)
 *                            - DNS resolution errors now appear in the log
 *                            - message send failures no longer add a MessageID to their corresponding log entry
 *                            - removed unesessary "using" statements as recommended by Visual Studio
 *                            
 *   2.4.3 (October 15, 2015) - new option added to GUI called "Append date to subject." This will cause the current date and time to be appended to the subject that has been
 *                              entered into the Subject field
 *                            - application gets the current date and time as soon as the Submit button is pressed (currentDateTime). This variable is then used in both the log, and
 *                              to append behind the subject if the "Append Date to subject" check box is checked. This ensures that the appended date and time matches the date and time
 *                              stamped in the log exactly. Previously, the log time would be a second ahead of the time that was appended to the subject due to when I was pulling the
 *                              current time for the various parts of the application.
 *                            - changed log column Server to Recipient server. Changed label "receiving server" to "recipient server"
 *                            - the option "manually specify recipient server" is now unchecked by default
 *                            
 *   2.5.0 (Dec 3, 2015)      - Border colour changed for both Log buttons to match the rest of the UI (changed from Black to Gray)
 *                            - Reply-To address can now be set
 *                            
 *   2.5.1 (June 30, 2016)    - when the recipient domain is Microsoft.com, the MX will manually be set with a hard coded string. This is because
 *                              you cannot lookup with MX for microsoft.com from on the corporate network.
 *                              
 *   2.6.0 (June 27, 2018)    - Done: When there is an error, app now pops a new form with a text box so the error can easily be copied out. Previous a message box had the error and you
 *                              can't copy text from a message box
 *                            - Done:From tag changed to MailFrom
 *                            - Done: When the success messgae box pops up, change the OK wording on the button to be "Nice!"
 *                            - Done: Some MessageBoxes had typos. Corrected
 *                            - Done: MessageBox that says the following when DNS lookup fails: "DNS resolution error, no MX record found. You may need to manually specify the recipient server."
 *                            
 *   2.6.1 (August 24, 2018)  - The last update broke the ability to set a P2 (From) address. This update fixes that                          
 *   
 *   2.7.0 (Nov 30, 2018)     - When there is an error, the full error will now appear in the log for ease of access later, or for export to a CSV file.
 *   
 *   2.8.0 (March 21, 2019)   - double clicking on a cell in the log now pops up a new window with a text box which contains the contents of that cell. This allows text that may be cut off in the   
 *                              cell to be easily viewed without needing to copy the cell and then paste it into another program like notepad. The title of the popup will match the header
 *                              cell of the cell that was double clicked on
 *                            - build version updated on .exe file. If you right click the EXE and look at properties, the version now properly matches
 *                              the application version. Previously it was showing version 2.5.1.
 *                            - Port can now always be changed, regardless of the setting of the text box "Manually specify recipient server"
 *                            - Cleaned up some text boxes that did not have a header on them (I added "Input Validation" as the header on them)
 *                            - Hitting tab now allows you to move focus in order to all of the available controls. This includes those that appear when you select "advanced options"
 *                            - Text validation is now performed on the Port text box. An error will appear if this box contains anything other than an integer 
 *                            - Due to processing order, a non-sensical error (Error: A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket is not connected and (when sending on 
 *                              a datagram socket using a sendto call) no address was supplied) would previously appear if you could not reach the recipient server on port 25. This error has 
 *                              now been cleaned up.
 *                            - the code that detects if an end point is reachable has been optimized and better calls out a connection issue if the end point cannot be reached  
 *                             
 *   3.0.0 (May 16, 2019)     - launch on Github!
 *                            - code cleanup
 *                            - Added check box to disable the "is recipient server reachable" test
 *                            - "sending message timeout" is now configurable
 *                            - input validation test for timeout text box (ensures value is a number)
 *                            - with server test not enabled, test app at home
 *                            - if "recipient server" was checked but nothing was entered in the text box the error would not trigger properly. This is now fixed.
 *                            - application currently does not check for updates
 *                              
 *   3.1.0 (July 2019)        - migrating the app from SmtpClient Class in DotNet (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.smtpclient?view=netframework-4.7.2), which 
 *                            - has been depreciated, to MailKit and MimeKit (https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit and https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit)
 *                            - http://www.mimekit.net/docs/html/N_MailKit.htm
 *                            - https://csharp.hotexamples.com/examples/MailKit.Net.Smtp/SmtpClient/Send/php-smtpclient-send-method-examples.html
 *                            - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37853903/can-i-send-files-via-email-using-mailkit
 *                            - https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit
 *                            - with the move to MailKit & MimeKit, code related to the SmtpClient Class in DotNet has now been removed
 *                            - application now creates an SMTP log (smtp.log) in the same directory where the executable resides
 *                            - a new button called "Open SMTP log" has been added to the log view. This will open the smtp.log file in Notepad for easy access.
 *                            
 *   3.1.2 (Sept 9, 2019)     - the "Open SMTP log" button (viewable when "View Log" is selected) did not move when "Advanced Options" was selected. This has now been fixed.
 *                            - I was unable to edit the text in the text box on the about window. The form would continually flash and visual studio would stop responding.
 *                              To fix this, I had to expand AboutForm.cs, and then edit AboutForm.resx. On that page you'll see the content of the text box on the about form
 *                              and I was able to edit it there. Not sure what's going on with that.
 *                              
 *   3.1.3 (Oct 31, 2019)     - "Open SMTP log" button now moves side to side when the width of the form is changed while viewing the log  
 *   
 *   3.1.4 (Nov 29, 2019)     - "Open SMTP log" button was not moving properly when "Advanced Options" was enabled and "View Log" was toggled. This has now been fixed
 *                            - MailKit & MimeKit updated from version 2.3.2 to 2.4.1
 *                            
 *   3.1.5 (Jan 8, 2020)      - Target .NET Framework bumped to version 4.6.
 *                            - Application name changed to "Supa Awesome Mailflow Tester" in honor of Dog Man which I'm currently reading to my son.
 *   
 *   3.1.6 (June 2020)        - Ctrl-A will now select all text in a message box. Previously, you would have to manually select the text in a message box if you wanted to copy it
 *                            - GitHub link on About page has been updated to point to the correct location. Previously the link returned a 404 error.
 *                            - BouncyCastle updated from 1.8.5 to 1.8.6.1
 *                            - MailKit updated from 2.4.1 to 2.7.0
 *                            - MimeKit updated from 2.4.1 to 2.8.0
 *                            
 *   3.1.7 (January 7, 2021)  - Ctrl-A will now work in the "Change log" text field on the About page
 *                            - About form will now appear direclty on top of the app, as opposed to popping up on a different monitor (if multiple monitors are being used)
 *                            - Updated the syntax for New MailboxAddress. I was previously using a syntax that is now obsolete.
 *                            - Application will no longer crash if smtp.log is locked by another application
 *                            - removed "Return" code lines and replaced them with application exception (throw new ApplicationException). This now allows the program to execute the
 *                              "catch" code block when we need to stop running which will properly close smtp.log file. When I was using returns, "catch" would not be run which
 *                              resulted in the file smtp.log not being closed properly.
 *                            - Button added to open windows explorer to the location where smtp.log is located 
 *                            - error text box is now larger and no longer has a "close button." The button was redundant as the window can be closed with the X
 *                              in the upper right hand corner
 *                            - General cleanup of code
 *                            - MailKit and MimeKit updated to 2.10.1
 *                            - BouncyCastle updated to 1.8.9
 *                            
 *   3.1.8 (April 27, 2021)   - Fixed a bug that caused the MailFrom address to be set as the recipient address
 *                            - MailKit and MimeKit updated to 2.11.1
 *                            - BouncyCastle updated to 1.8.10
 *                            
 *   3.2.0 (Nov 25, 2021)     - Updated .NET from 4.6 to 4.8
 *                            - Updated MailKit from 2.11.1 to 2.15.0
 *                            - Updated MimeKit from 2.11.0 to 2.15.1
 *                            - Removed BouncyCastle.
 *                            - In the Log view within the app the date format has been updated to remove ambiguity and the time zone has now been added to the time stamp.
 *                            - If a P2 address is selected, the address will now appear in the log under the Options column
 *                            - If a Reply-To address is selected, the address will now appear in the log under the Options column
 *                            - Previously, if you click the View Log to open the log, rersized it, closed it and then re-opened again, the "Open SMTP log" button would be missing. This
 *                              bug has now been fixed.
 *                            - Application now identifies itself over HELO/EHLO as SupaAwesomeMailflowTester. Previously it just used the local IP of the machine on which it was running.
 *                            - When unchecking "Advanced Options", if a Reply-To address had been set it would continue to be used. This option is now unchecked when unchecking "Advanced Options." This mirrors
 *                              what happens with the rest of the Advanced Options settings.
 *                            - the Subject in the log will now populate propertly when there is a DNS Resolution Error. Previously the subject would be blank when theer was a DNS lookup error
 *                            - when there is a DNS Resolution Error, there will now be a single entry added to the log. Previously this caused two entries to the log.
 *                            - when there is a DNS Resolution Error, the recipienut server textbox will now clear the previous entry
 *   
 * Future  
 *        - clear SMTP log on app close? Not sure. I'm torn on how to handle this. I don't want to log to become massive, but I don't want to clear it without at least asking the user.
 *        - have SMTP log output to a window? Maybe make a new log checkbox which will show the SMTP log in an attached window? Or just have a link that will open up 
 *          the folder where the smtp log file exists?
 *        - with the move to github the application no longer checks for updates. I need to figure out where to host the install so I can have it check
 *          for updates again
 *        - Have app link directly in Start Menu, as opposed to being in a folder which is in the Start Menu. I don't know if this is possible with click to run
 *        - When adding a different P2 address, is there any way to tell the app to not add the header, "Sender," which casuses the (sent on behalf of) name in Outlook?
 *        - when opening the log, should the initial width be that of the datagrid? Currently the log always opens to the same width, which is the initial datagrid view
 *          width with no content present
 *        - Drag and drop attachements to the attachments window
 *        - option to have the app send x number of messages when Send is clicked (would need to have some sort of progress window appear when this is happening). Maybe change subject
 *          slightly for all sent messages (prepend with the message number. ex. 1, 2, 3)
 *        - App will look blury if you have multiple monitors with different resolutions as the app scales to the monitor with the lowest resolution, and so when it's moved to a monitor
 *          with the highest resolution it will look blury.
