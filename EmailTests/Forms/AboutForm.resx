    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>This application is used to send email messages for mail flow testing. I work as a support engineer with Microsoft and support Exchange Online.

  </data>
  <data name="textBox1.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3.2.0 (Nov 25, 2021)     
 - Updated .NET from 4.6 to 4.8
 - Updated MailKit from 2.11.1 to 2.15.0
 - Updated MimeKit from 2.11.0 to 2.15.1
 - Removed BouncyCastle.
 - In the Log view within the app the date format has been updated to 
    remove ambiguity and the time zone has now been added to the time stamp.
 - If a P2 address is selected, the address will now appear in the log under the 
    Options column
 - If a Reply-To address is selected, the address will now appear in the log
    under the Options column
 - Previously, if you clicked the View Log to open the log, resized it, closed it, 
    and then re-opened again, the "Open SMTP log" button would be missing. 
    This bug has now been fixed.
 - Application now identifies itself over HELO/EHLO as 
    SupaAwesomeMailflowTester. Previously it used the local IP of the
    machine on which it was running.
 - When unchecking "Advanced Options", if a Reply-To address had been set 
    it would continue to be used. This option is now unchecked when 
    unchecking "Advanced Options." This mirrors what happens with the rest 
    of the Advanced Options settings.
 - The Subject in the log will now populate properly when there is a DNS 
    Resolution Error. Previously the subject would be blank when there was a 
    DNS lookup error.
 - When there is a DNS Resolution Error, there will now be a single entry added
    to the log. Previously this caused two entries to be added to the log.
 - When there is a DNS Resolution Error, the recipient server textbox will now 
    clear the previous entry.

    smtp.log is located 
 - General cleanup of code

 - BouncyCastle updated to 1.8.9

3.1.6 (June 15, 2020)

    have to manually select the text in a message box if you wanted to 
    copy it.

3.1.2 (September 9, 2019)
 - the "Open SMTP log" button (viewable when "View Log" is selected)
    did not move when "Advanced Options" was selected. This has now
    been fixed.

3.1.0 (July 19, 2019)
 - migrating the app from SmtpClient Class in DotNet, which has been 
    depreciated, to MailKit and MimeKit
 - with the move to MailKit &amp; MimeKit, code related to the SmtpClient 
    Class in DotNet has now been removed
 - application now creates an SMTP log (smtp.log) in the same directory 
    where the executable resides
 - a new button called "Open SMTP log" has been added to the log view.
    This will open the smtp.log file in Notepad for easy access

3.0.0 (May 16, 2019)

2.8.0 (March 21, 2019)
 - double clicking on a cell in the log now pops up a new window with a text
    box which contains the contents of that cell. This allows text that may be 
    cut off in the cell to be easily viewed without needing to copy the cell and
    then paste it into another program like notepad
 - build version updated on .exe file. If you right click the EXE and look at
    properties, the version now properly matches the application version. 
    Previously it was showing version 2.5.1
 - Port can now always be changed. Previously, it could only be changed if 
    you checked off "manually specify receiving server."
 - Text validation is now performed on the Port text box. An error will appear if
    this text box contains anything other than an integer.
 - Cleaned up some text boxes that did not have a header on them (added
    "Input Validation" as the header
 - Hitting TAB now logically cycles between all controls which can be modified
 - Due to order processing previously, if the recipient server was not accessible
    over the specified port, a text box would appear with a nonsensical error.
    Now, if the recipient server cannot be reached, a clear error will pop up.
 - the code that detects if an end point is reachable has been optimized and 
    better calls out a connection issue if the end point cannot be reached 

2.7.0 (November 30, 2018)

 - The option "manually specify recipient server" is now unchecked by 
    default.

2.4.1 (September 28, 2015)
 - Application width can now be changed while the log is visible (there
    is a minimum width that the application enforces while the log is visible).
 - DNS resolution errors now appear in the log.
 - Message send failures no longer add a MessageID to their corresponding
    log entry.
 - Instructions to use the application have been added as a link to the About
    form.
 - UI updates for consistency across the application.

2.3.5 (July 23, 2015) 
 - Application now gracefully closes the TCP connections that it 
    establishes. You will no longer see RST (resets) in a network trace.
    You will see the proper [FIN, ACK] TCP teardown sequence after
    the message is sent.

2.3.4 (June 22, 2015)
 - TCP connection to see if recipient server is reachable did not close after 
    it was established. This connection now properly closes.
 - TCP connection to see if recipient server is reachable always used port 25. 
    This  test now properly uses the port entered into the application.
 - Start menu folder name changed from "Andrew Stobart" to "Mail Flow 
    Tester"
